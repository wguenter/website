    //-     h3 Visualizing the Black Box of Machine Learning: Challenges and Opportunities

        
    //-     p
    //-       | Machine learning (ML) has witnessed tremendous successes in the last decade in classification,
    //-       | regression, and prediction tasks. However, many ML models are used, and sometimes even designed, as black boxes.
    //-       | When such models do not operate properly, their creators do not often know what is the best way to improve them.
    //-       | Moreover, even when operating successfully, users often require to understand how and why they take certain
    //-       | decisions to gain trust therein. We present how information visualization and visual analytics help towards
    //-       | explaining (and improving) ML models. These cover tasks such as understanding high-dimensional datasets; understanding
    //-       | unit specialization during the training of deep learning models; exploring how training samples determine the shape of
    //-       | classification decision boundaries; and helping users annotating samples in semi-supervised active learning scenarios.

    //-     h3 #[Problem-Driven Visualization Through Design Studies]
        
    //-     p 
    //-       | Design studies are a popular approach to problem-driven research in the field of visualization.
    //-       | I define a design study as a situation where visualization researchers analyze a specific real-world problem faced by domain experts,
    //-       | design a visualization system that supports solving this problem, validate the design,
    //-       | and reflect about lessons learned in order to refine visualization design guidelines.
    //-       | I will discuss the methodology of conducting these studies and processes to help researchers and practitioners avoid potential pitfalls.
    //-       | For example, one consideration for success in such projects is ensuring that the collaboration incentives are aligned for all parties.
    //-       | I will illustrate the potential and challenges of design studies through case studies in three application domains:
    //-       | conducting facilities management and planning with building occupancy data, analyzing consumer behaviour with e-commerce clickstream data,
    //-       | and investigating biological hypotheses through the relationships between many evolutionary trees for both species and genes.
